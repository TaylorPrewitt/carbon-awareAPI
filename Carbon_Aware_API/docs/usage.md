# How to Use the API

## Set Up
This section will take you through setting up the Carbon Aware API on your local machine for local development and testing. 

### Necessary Packages:
The required packages and their minimum versions needed are listed [here](https://github.com/TaylorPrewitt/carbon-awareAPI/blob/main/Carbon_Aware_API/requirements.txt). 


### Set up a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment either using the [venv module](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) or a [Conda Environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). Please look to their respective documentations on installation, set-up, and usage.
